              p When selecting a jurisdiction to place an online betting, bingo, casino, eSports, sports betting, or lottery business, it is important to consider the initial licensing costs and maintenance costs as well as the tax burden and the benefits of each jurisdiction.
              p All legal online gaming companies must be registered and meet the requirements in at least one jurisdiction. The most common jurisdictions for obtaining the appropriate license are Curaçao, Costa Rica, Malta, and the United Kingdom.
            .tab-pane.fade#gambling2
              p Many prefer traditional options such as the UK or Malta, but applying for a license in these jurisdictions is expensive, complicated, and time-consuming. For those planning to launch a startup with a new product, it can be quite a risky process. That is why at Acalista, we recommend that you test your concept and product before making the final decision.
            .tab-pane.fade#gambling3
              p Among the few countries where a gaming license can be obtained, the most popular option is Curaçao. There are a number of reasons for that: the license does not require a personal visit, only a minimum time period is required, the procedure is extremely simple, and, finally, the budget is most comfortable.
              p Moreover, global suppliers of games willingly collaborate with a company if it has a Curaçao license. In addition, the country has some of the most favorable tax benefits, no sales tax, no import duties, no VAT, and no restrictions on dividend withdrawal.

                  p You can get a banking license in any country in the world, but there are countries where the procedure is easier and cheaper. Offshore banks are attractive for preferential taxation, as they either do not pay taxes at all or pay them at a much lower rate than resident banks.
                .tab-pane.fade#fintech5
                  p International bank license is the most common type of offshore license, allowing you to do business only with clients outside the country where your bank is located.
                  p General bank license allows you to conduct business with clients both inside and outside the country where the bank is located. Capital requirements to open this type of bank are much higher, and banks with a general banking license face much greater regulation.
                  p Limited bank license: banks with this type of license are usually used only to serve a group of wealthy people or for multinational corporations, to manage their international obligations. The peculiarity of banks with a limited license is that they can only enter into contracts with a certain number of persons, which are specified in the license.
                  p We offer a wide range of countries where you can obtain an offshore banking license: Saint Lucia, the Cayman Islands, Bahamas, Panama, and others. In addition, we operate across Europe, obtaining banking licenses in the Eurozone.
